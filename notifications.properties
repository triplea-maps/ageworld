Note1=<body><center><img src="PrimevalAge.png"/></center><h2>Round 1-5</h2>European history did not pass as you might have thought. Already in this early age,<br>eight tribes dominated the world. The tribes greatest enemies were savage barbarians as well as Mother Nature.<br> The tribes soon learned that the Wild Mammoth could be captured and domesticated.<br> Many tribes also soon invented the hand axe to battle their foes.<br>Age gives +1 Tech and +5 PUs per turn, besides territory income. Certain tribes may <br>receive more or less PUs and/or tech tokens in different ages. On turn 1 go to edit mode and make all 8 tribes <br>at default war with each other or whatever. This is no longer 4 against 4. <br> In playtesting I can tell there are some inherent problems that have to do with <br>geography and balance. This is a counterfactual history of the world and every game plays out differently. <br>I have played Europe and dominated from early on and even invaded America, but a more likely scenario is that <br> Inca defeats Aztec or vise-versa, then is able to build vast armies which will eventually dominate the world.<br> This is because China, India, MiddleEast and the Slavs are duking it out and expending their armies.<br> The only answer I can see (I keep trying different solutions) is to ally the weaker tribes in different ways. <br>As I write this I am thinking of starting the next game with the MiddleEast, India and the Slavs (probably the 3 weaker tribes due <br>to geography) allied. (You just set this up at the beginning with the edit mode in <br>political relationships.) Inca and Aztec can be put in check if one starts to dominate the other by setting them to cold war relationship. <br> When you start in Caveman times and work your way to the futuristic age with missiles and nuclear bombs<br> (it takes many hours to get there) bad things tend to happen. Because losing capitals does not mean loss of income<br> or ability to build, a tribe can migrate to another part of the world and rebuild if need be. However there are 10 victory<br> cities each worth 1 victory point. These are the 8 tribal capitals plus New York and the United Kingdom.<br> A tribe (or alliance) must hold 7 victory cities to win the game. (Untested as I write this) Two new units will arrive later in<br> the game, these are Generals and War Robots. (War Robots were there before but are different now.) Generals are<br> able to produce 2 new units without a factory and War-Robots can produce 1 new unit and provide artillery support for 3<br> infantry type units. Be careful with these new units because they can be captured. See notes for more info.<br>
Another thing is that if you want to make it all the way to the futuristic age (in order to have<br> the full game experience) you will probably at some point either change who you are playing and/or change the<br> political relationships. This is definitely not your typical triplea game experience where either axis or allies win. This<br> is crazy free for all world history where sometimes the gods must intervene lest chaos should ensue. For those who<br> have never played age of tribes it is already different with barbarian tribes and wild animals early on, the endless<br> tech trees, plagues, convoy centers and eventual nuclear war. But on the world map it is a whole new ballgame.<br><br><br><center><img src="info.png"/></center></body>

It changed the conditions of war. Footmen became heavier, horsemen<br>became steel-plated, and even siege weapons began shooting further. However, the<br>effectiveness of enemy weaponry was not the only concern of the tribes. Rumors had<br>it that an all destructive plague was ravaging Asia, and this plague, this Black Death,<br>was about to hit Europe.<br><br>Age gives +20 Tech and +20 PUs per turn, besides territory income.<br>The Black Death is set to arrive in the end of round 26.<br>Use military units to contain and eradicate the plague.<br>All Axemen and Mammoths are now outdated.</body>

The technological advances<br>in industry and science were to revolutionize warfare. It became possible to mass-<br>produce weapons with enhanced range, accuracy and lethality. Military conditions<br>were in constant flux during the industrial age as new weapons were developed and<br>transportation and communication improved.
